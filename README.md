### 2. Write a Good Commit Message
You have written some code in your branch, and are ready to commit. So, make sure to written good, clean commit messages. Let's review the anatomy of a commit message.

```
---
First line, no more than 50 characters

Details section, as long as you want. Not always necessary, but
available if you need it. Wrapped at 72 characters. Present imperative
tense is preferred for commits. That means "fix bug", not "fixes bug" or
"fixed bug".

- Use bullets if you need
- Bullets are a good way to summarize a few things

If you have too much info here, it might be a good candidate to break
down into multiple commits. You can use emoji here too :sparkles:
